           (i.e. the user inviting) is in the channel, the invitee will join the channel

           (i.e. no Exception raised, or anything printed out)
    For channel_details_v1:
        - Only prints out public details of a channel (see more in channel_join_v1)

          channel

    For channels_listall_v1:
